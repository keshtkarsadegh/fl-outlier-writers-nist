The appendix tables, held to the claims they make about themselves.

Four of them said something the file behind them did not support, and each
failure was silent in the same way: the table still rendered, the numbers were
all real, and the only thing wrong was what they meant.

    tab:fairness       printed an unweighted mean over CLIENTS in a column
                       headed Mean, beside two tables printing an accuracy
                       pooled over ROWS for the same arm under the same name.
                       It promised every carried arm at every setting and
                       printed no five-client block and one arm of three at
                       twenty.
    tab:selection_axis printed a rank taken from the records' stored ordering,
                       which is ordered by adaptation, while every shortlist in
                       the study was cut on the selection score. Its ranks
                       reproduced the adaptation ordering exactly and it showed
                       no validation preservation at all.
    tab:reg_winners    printed a no-penalty control on the cyclic block, where
                       the proximal family's best cell happens to be mu = 0,
                       and none on the parallel block.
    tab:kholdout       printed six rows that expanded to nineteen of the
                       twenty-eight protocols its own caption counted.

None of the four can be caught by re-reading the generator, because the
generator did exactly what it was told. They are caught here, on the emitted
LaTeX and on the views behind it.
