SUPERSEDED as an emitter - see tools/make_digits_p11.py.

Its ``RESULTS`` constant is ``$FOA_RESULTS_DIR/main_v6``, a root from a study
that has since been deleted, and ``tools/make_study_sbatch.py`` refuses any
task file naming it. The aggregation screen this study ran is
``jobs/s09_agg_screen2.txt``, emitted by ``tools/make_digits_p11.py
--jobs-dir <dir>`` and reproducible from it byte for byte.

``task_line`` and ``flag_tokens`` here are still imported - by this file's own
selector and by the stage-8 emitter, both likewise superseded - so the module
is kept rather than deleted. The config-driven replacement for the line
builder is ``federated_outlier_adaptation.training.study_lines``, which says
in its own header why it exists.

Emit the stage-6 screening task file and the README that decodes its cell ids.

    python tools/make_stage6_screen.py [--out PATH] [--readme PATH] [--folds 1 2 3 4 5]

Reads nothing but the cell table in
:mod:`federated_outlier_adaptation.training.agg_cells`, so it is a login-node
job: it writes two text files and touches no data.

One line per (cell, fold).  Every line is stage 5's protocol with one thing
changed - the server rule and its coefficients - so a difference between two
lines is the rule and not the arrangement around it.
