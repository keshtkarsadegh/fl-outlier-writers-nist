# Assemble the complete programme of Digits_study01 into a fresh results root.
#
# Nothing is inherited: the run starts from by_write.zip and ends at the paper's
# tables. The task files of the stages that already have them are reused
# verbatim - they are committed and checksummed, and every path in them is
# $FOA_STUDY_DIR, so pointing that at a new root is the whole of the change.
#
# What this script adds, because the old tree had it only by hand:
#   * a producer for cohort_worst5.json. Nothing in jobs/v4 wrote it; the
#     five-client stage read it as though it appeared on its own, so a run from
#     zero would have stopped there.
#   * uniform --outer-workers 1 --inner-workers 1 on every line, so that
#     seconds-per-round finally measures the algorithm and not the launch.
#
# What it deliberately drops:
#   p04            the v1 selection, superseded by p05v2
#   p07            retrains g-0, which p05v2 already does; its evaluations are
#                  in p05v2 too
#   p08 p09 p10    the ten-client references, superseded by the per-size
#                  reference files which cover 5, 10, 20 and the extremes
#   p20_runs_f1    the fold-1 subset of p20_runs
#
# REQUIRED
#   FOA_PROJECT_DIR   the workspace whose jobs/v4/ holds the task files read
#                     here, the same root the stage READMEs under
#                     study/artifacts/Digits_study01/jobs/ write them into.
#                     The assembled programme goes to results_v5/ beside it.

# the line is here now, cut from the same ranking and by the same rule as the

# The five worst are a subset of the ten worst, so they share the ten-client
