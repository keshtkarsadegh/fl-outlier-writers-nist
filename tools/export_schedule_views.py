"""
The schedule, given a table of its own.

Every stage of the programme selected and reported the two schedules
SEPARATELY - which is right, because a rule that only exists on one of them
cannot be ranked against a rule that only exists on the other - and the cost of
that is that the comparison a reader makes first has no view. Parallel and
cyclic rows sit interleaved in `agg-winners.csv`, `reg-winners.csv` and
`combos.csv`, sorted by score and not by schedule, so "does it matter which way
round you run it?" is answered by scrolling three files and pairing rows by eye.

    python tools/export_schedule_views.py --root "$FOA_STUDY_DIR" \\
        --csv "$FOA_STUDY_DIR/tables/paper/"

THIS IS A CORE VIEW, not an extension. The schedule is an axis of the programme
rather than something screened beside it: every arm below is an arm a shipped
table already reports, read at the reporting horizon on the basis those tables
are measured on, and no `ctune_` folder is read anywhere here.

WHAT THE FIRST VIEW ANSWERS. Six pairs, each the same thing run both ways -
the control, each schedule's selected rule, the penalty that rule is paired
with, each schedule's own selected logit and NTD cell, and the crowned pair
against the cyclic arm that was carried beside it. EVERY ROW IS AN ARM A
SELECTION RECORD NAMES, and the control is the one row nothing selected because
it is what the selecting is measured against. Nothing is ranked into this table
by the numbers this table then prints: a row that led the test column at report
time would be a row the study never shipped, which is what the two rows that
have left this view were - the rule that led on test, now the rule its schedule
selected, and the best combination of the cross, which is gone. A pair is only
worth stating if both halves are the arm that schedule actually selected, which
is why four of the six are two DIFFERENT cells: the cyclic grid crowned
`ntd_b0p01_t2` where the parallel one crowned `ntd_b0p01_t0p5`, and forcing one
cell across both schedules would report a setting one of them never chose.

PAIRED BY FOLD, and the mean is not the finding. The five folds are the same
five re-draws for every arm, so a fold that is hard for one arm is hard for
all of them; differencing within a fold removes that shared difficulty, and
comparing two means does not. So every row carries its five per-fold
differences and how many of the five the cyclic half won, beside the mean -
`compare_arms.py` documents at length what reading a mean of this size without
its spread did to the combination stage, and this table is the same size of
effect.

    schedule_pairs.csv   six pairs, cyclic minus parallel, TEST, full horizon
    schedule_top.csv     the study's eight strongest arms, with their schedule

WHICH ARMS ARE READ, NOT TYPED. The rule is the head of the aggregation
screen's own ranking in `tables/p12_agg_top3.json`, read under the basis that
record says it was ranked on - which is the cell each schedule selected, and on
the parallel side is NOT the cell that record's test order puts first. The blend
is the penalty half of `make_digits_p23.THE_PAIR`, which is where this
repository records the penalty each schedule's rule was paired with. The logit
and NTD cells come from `tables/p13_reg_method_winners.json`, which crowns per
method AND per schedule, and the crowned pair and the arm carried beside it out
of `tables/p15_stage_winner.json`. The control is the one unflagged cell of
`agg_cells.control_cells()`. Naming any of them here would let this view outlive
the selection that put the arm in it.

ONE BASIS. Both views are TEST, because both report; nothing here ranks a
selection. A0 and P0 are the shipped model's own two accuracies, read through
`report_tables` at call time and never written down.
