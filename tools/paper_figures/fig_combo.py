"""The crowned combination, beside each of its two components.

The combination the frozen record crowned is a server rule and a client-side
penalty run together.  It is drawn here against the same server rule with no
penalty, the same penalty under the plain server rule, and the unprotected
control both components were selected over, so the reader can see which
component carries which part of the result.

        The selected pair against each of its two components and against
        the unprotected control, over the full hundred-round budget on the
        study's ten-client cohort: accuracy on the source population (left,
        preservation) and on the outlier cohort (right, adaptation), split-mean
        over the five splits on the validation rows.  All four arms run the
        parallel schedule and start from the shipped model at round 0; the
        server rule is the anchor at $h=2R$ and the penalty is FedNTD at
        $\beta=0.01$, $\tau=0.5$.
