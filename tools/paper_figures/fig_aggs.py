"""What the selected server rules do, each readable against the control.

Four panels: preservation on the left, adaptation on the right.  Every panel
carries the two references everything is measured against --- the plain
federated-averaging control as a black dashed curve, drawn on top so it is
never hidden, and the shipped model's own accuracy as the dotted horizontal
line every arm starts from.  The three selected rules are split across the two rows so that no
panel has to carry all three: the anchor and the server step share the top
row, and the weighting rule has the bottom row to itself.

        The three selected server rules on the parallel schedule with no
        client-side penalty, over the full hundred-round budget on the
        ten-client cohort, split-mean over the five splits on the validation
        rows.  Every panel repeats the federated-averaging control (black,
        dashed) and the shipped model's accuracy (dotted); the three rules
        are split across the two rows, the server anchor and the server step
        at $\eta_s{=}0.95$ on the top row and uniform weighting alone on the
        bottom.  Validation basis, so the endpoints
        are not the test-set figures the tables report.
