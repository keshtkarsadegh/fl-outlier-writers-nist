"""What a client-side penalty alone can do.

One arm per regularisation family --- the strength that family's own search
selected --- plus the no-penalty control they are all measured against, over
the full hundred-round budget.  Every arm here runs the cyclic schedule, which
is the schedule the no-penalty control was selected under, so the schedule is
held fixed and the only thing that varies across the seven curves is the
penalty.

        One arm per regularisation family, at the strength that family's own
        search selected, against the no-penalty control, over the full
        hundred-round budget on the study's ten-client cohort: accuracy on the
        source population (left, preservation) and on the outlier cohort
        (right, adaptation), split-mean over the five splits on the validation
        rows.  All seven arms run the same cyclic schedule and start from the
        shipped model at round 0, so the curves differ only in the penalty.
        Only the four curves the text argues from are drawn
        --- the falling control, logit matching, FedNTD, and one
        EWC arm --- the remaining families are read from the
        table.  Validation basis, so the endpoints are not the
        test-set figures the tables report.
