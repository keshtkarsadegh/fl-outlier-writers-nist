"""The two extreme arrangements, and when they should have stopped.

At one or two clients there is nothing left to average, and the fixed
hundred-round budget stops being a schedule and becomes a hazard: every
arrangement reaches its best trade in the first tens of rounds and then spends
the rest of the horizon taking the source model apart.  Two rounds are marked
on every curve.  The filled marker is the round the rule KEEPS --- the best
cohort round along the validation trace, which on both arrangements is the round
that maximises the study's own selection score as well.  The open marker is the
round the rule runs out of patience: the study's one permitted stopping rule
keeps the checkpoint of that best round and stops training after k rounds
without an improvement on it.

    python fig_extremes.py       # regenerates fig_extremes.pdf from ../data

Reads traces_extreme.csv and plateau_extremes.csv, both of which carry the
rounds already computed; nothing is re-derived here.

        The two extreme arrangements under the fixed hundred-round budget,
        both running the crowned configuration at full participation: the two
        worst-served writers held as two clients, and the same writers' rows
        merged into one client, so the two hold identical data and differ
        only in whether the aggregation ever sees a client boundary.
        Accuracy on the source population (left) and on the two writers' own
        rows (right), split-mean on the validation rows.  Filled markers
        give each arrangement's best round by the selection score; open
        markers the round the early-stopping rule fires.  Adaptation is
        complete at the filled marker while preservation is still near the
        shipped model; every round after only destroys.
