"""The distillation-plus-elastic-weight mixtures against their two parents.

One row of panels per schedule, so the parents and their own mixtures are
never drawn over the other schedule's: within each row the two parents carry
the interval, and the blend leaves that interval only on preservation, where
it holds at or above the elastic-weight parent.  On adaptation it stays inside
it, below the distillation parent for all but a handful of rounds --- which is
why the caption reports the construction and not a win.

        The distillation-plus-elastic-weight construction of each schedule
        against the two parents it was built from, one row of panels per
        schedule: accuracy on the source population (left, preservation) and
        on the outlier cohort (right, adaptation), split-mean over the five
        splits on the validation rows, from the shipped model at round 0.
        In each row the parents are the orange and blue curves, distillation
        and the elastic-weight term, and the green curve is that schedule's own
        construction at $m{=}0.5$; the composite each schedule's validation
        ordering selected is the $m{=}0.5$ cell built from the other
        schedule's components (Table~\ref{tab:selection_axis}), and the other
        two ratios are in the released records.  On the left the blend holds
        the elastic-weight parent's preservation; on the right it tracks below
        the distillation parent on both rows, crossing just above it in the
        closing rounds of the cyclic row, and, on the parallel row, below both
        parents by the end of the budget.  Validation basis, so the endpoints
        are not the test-set figures the tables report.
