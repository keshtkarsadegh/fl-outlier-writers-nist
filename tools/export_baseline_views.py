"""
The two baseline views `fig_baselines` is drawn on: what the shipped model cost
to train, and what fine-tuning one client in isolation does to it.

Neither is a federated result and neither belongs in `report_tables.py`, which
reports arms. These are the two rungs the arms are read against - the model
before anything touched it, and the extreme in the other direction from the
extremes: no federation at all, one client training alone.

    python tools/export_baseline_views.py --root "$FOA_STUDY_DIR" --out paper/data

`g0_training.csv` is g-0's own training history, one row per (fold, epoch), read
from each fold's `global_results/global_metrics.json`. The folds stop at
different epochs because training early-stops on validation, so the file is
ragged by design and anything reading it has to mean over the folds that reached
a given epoch rather than over five.

`isolated_clients.csv` is one row per (cohort client, fold): what the shipped
model already got right on that client's own test rows, and what one client
training alone reaches - from g-0 and from scratch - on its own rows and on the
source population. THE ISOLATION RECORDS STORE TEST EVALUATIONS ONLY, so this
view is on the test basis throughout while the per-round views beside it are on
validation. The two are not comparable and the figure's caption says so.

The shipped model's own per-client accuracies come from
`g0_perfold_evaluations.json` - the same file `report_tables.baselines` reads
`A0` out of - rather than from the isolation records, so the "before" column is
the study's own evaluation of g-0 and not a number the isolation stage recomputed.

TEN SIGNIFICANT FIGURES. Both files carry accuracies as `%.10g`, which is what
the manuscript's own build wrote and is far more precision than any of them is
worth; it is fixed here so that a regenerated view is byte-comparable with the
shipped one rather than differing in the last place for no reason.
