"""
Where the per-round *source* series is measured, and what to do when there is nowhere.

Both federated runners score the server model once a round on a "global" set and
record it next to the clients number.  That set used to be one thing and one
thing only: the writers named in ``results/writer_split.json``, the frozen 3%
source population of the published pipeline.  Two problems with that, and the
first one is fatal.

**It is not optional.**  ``provider.global_client_ids()`` opens that file, so a
results root without one cannot start a federated run at all - the loop dies in
setup, before the first round, with a ``FileNotFoundError``.  The v6 protocol
draws its populations with ``select-outliers`` and ``draw-old-data`` and never
writes a writer split, so every v6 federated run was unstartable.

**It is not the old data.**  The 3% split is cut across *all* writers, and the
v6 cohort is cut by score across all writers too, so the two can overlap: a
cohort writer can sit in the source set and be counted as "preserved knowledge"
while the federation is actively training on it.  It is also the expensive
evaluation of the round, at roughly 25k images.

So the series follows the old-data book when there is one: fold k's *test* rows,
where k is the fold the run itself was split by, at roughly 6k rows.  That makes
it a cheap, honest, clearly-labelled **diagnostic** - it says *when* something
happened over the rounds.  It is not the preservation figure.  The preservation
figure is the five-split set computed on the final server model by
:mod:`federated_outlier_adaptation.training.final_eval`, and nothing here
replaces it.

The three cases, in order:

``book``
    an old-data book was supplied - fold k's test rows, and its validation rows
    for the source-validation series.
``writer_split``
    no book, but the results root has the frozen split - the published
    behaviour, bit-for-bit, so every v4 and v5 run is unchanged.
``none``
    neither - a warning, and the run proceeds with no source series rather than
    dying in setup over a diagnostic.
