"""
The aggregation screen's task lines, addressed at one study.

The protocol is the one every stage of this study shares - the cohort, its fold
book, the old book, g-0, nine of ten clients per round - and the only thing a
line varies is the **server rule** and the coefficients it runs at.  The rules
themselves come from :mod:`.agg_cells`, unchanged: the cell table is the
science, and a line is only its address.

Why this module exists at all
-----------------------------
The screen's line builder used to live in ``tools/make_stage6_screen.py``, which
hard-codes a results root and a sixteen-of-twenty sampler from a study that has
since been deleted.  Rather than edit a file whose outputs were already
submitted, this carries a config-driven builder over the same table.

Method grouping
---------------
The full-horizon stage that follows a screen runs **one line per method at its
best coefficients**, so "method" has to be a definition rather than an
intuition.  :func:`agg_method_of` groups the 169 cells into 18: a coefficient
row like ``eta_*`` is one method at several settings, while ``weight_uniform``
and ``weight_capped`` are two methods - a weighting rule is not a coefficient of
another weighting rule - and the two controls are likewise distinct, because a
control with the oracle stop rule armed is not a setting of the control without
it.

            which would rank 432 cells of two different pairs against each
            other and crown one of them.
